#asocial

> I created *asocial* so that I could freely and privately muse amongst myself.

That's a mouthful. I was in a bit of a quirky mood when I wrote this README.

I write a lot and I try to encourage others around me to write. One barrier to entry is figuring out what to write and where to write it. In an attempt to write even more, I recently decided to start writing letters to myself. I wrote them in plain-text (with Markdown syntax) and stored them in a folder, but that solution was a bit clumsy.

It's clumsy because opening a text file buried deep on my disk is kinda clumsy and because my preferred text editor is also my code editor. Because I work on several projects, I'm often closing and opening things in that editor. It also happens that my editor is a bit slow and it sucks at spell check.

I'm a web developer so I spend most of my day in a web browser. If opening a text file, dozens of times a day, is too much of a chore, flipping to a tab in my browser might be the answer. To further reduce the resistance, I decided to write *short messages* instead of *letters*.

The end result is *asocial*.

You can send short messages to yourself and they get tagged with a timestamp and put into a larger box on the page. The plan is to save that text to localStorage so it's semi-permanent. Then I'll add an option to *save* the document as a text file somewhere. Maybe I'll do that weekly or so. For now, I can just copy and paste from it.

I haven't decided how I'm going to license this yet but I did make the source available on Github. I'll probably end up using some type of OSS license.
